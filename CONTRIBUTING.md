# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Lexi — we appreciate all help!

How to contribute

1. Search existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicating work.
2. Open an issue to discuss larger changes before implementing.
3. Fork the repository and create a feature branch for your change.
4. Follow the existing code style and best practices (TypeScript, Next.js App Router, Tailwind).
5. Add tests for new functionality where appropriate.
6. Run the project's linters and type checks before opening a PR.

Testing locally

- Install dependencies: `bun install` (or your preferred package manager configured for this repo).
- Start dev server: `bun run dev`.
- Run type checks and linters: `bun run build` (the build runs type checking in this project).

Pull request guidelines

- Use a descriptive title and include a short description of your change.
- Link any related issues and provide steps to reproduce the problem and test your fix.
- Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
- Address maintainers' review comments promptly.

Code style

- Use TypeScript and prefer narrow types (avoid `any` where practical).
- Follow existing file organization and component patterns.
- Run the project's linters and type checks before submitting.

Security issues

- If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, follow the instructions in `SECURITY.md` to report it privately.

Thank you for contributing — we look forward to your contributions!
